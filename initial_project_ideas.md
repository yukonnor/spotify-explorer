# Project Ideas

## Spotify Playlist / Genre Explorer
- **This is the idea I'm selecting**
- Problem: Spotify’s app only gives you limited information about the songs in your playlists. It makes it hard to learn more about the songs and makes it impossible to filter or sort songs based on song metadata like genre, tempo, and feel. 
- Basic Functionality: The app would let you share a public Spotify playlist and it will analyze it and show you all of the available metadata about the songs in the playlist.
  - You could then filter and sort the songs in the playlist based on all availability metadata and create a new 
  - You can also click through to explore the genres in your list, which you return artists that make music in that genre, audio previews, and again metadata that you can sort or filter by. 
  - You can login to save your favorite playlists or genres.
- APIs: Spotify API (+ Possibly ChatGPT for more musical exploration)
  

## Guitar / Bass Practice Repository
- Problem: There are millions of guitar practice websites out there, but none of them neatly organize/index common exercises or let you track your progress with exercises.
- Basic Functionality: This app would let you explore, view, favorite, etc guitar/bass exercises and track how well you can play them (self reported)
  - It will provide a metronome. Once you can play comfortably at that tempo you can record it as a tempo you’ve achieved. You can then go to a view of your ‘tempos achieved’ over time. 
  - You could create a ‘practice routine’ of exercises to perform in a session
  - You could create new exercises and share them with others.  
- APIs: ??? 

## Friend Activity Pairing
- Problem: It can be hard to gauge which activities your friends would be open to doing or what their schedules are. Typically, to make a plan, one friend has to offer a specific activity at a specific time and wait to hear if it’s something the other friend wants to do. 
- Basic Functionality: You can list certain activities you're ‘always down for’ and the days / times you’re open to doing them.
  - You can add friends and see what they’re down for
  - You can then send a request to do something they’re down for (or just contact them if you already have their contact info). 
  - Have a public view where you meet new friends who have similar interests and availability. 
- APIs: Maybe the Eventbrite or Meetup API to suggest things to do. Google Calendar possibly. 

## Personal Music Library
- Problem: You may have a bunch of records, cds and tapes, but what if you want to reference them / organize them without physically shuffling through them? 
- Basic Functionality: The app would essentially be a clone of Discog’s “Collection” feature where you can select which albums you have in your collection.
  - You can then view metadata about your collection, tag them, etc.
  - You can jump off to Discogs or Spotify to learn more, shop, listen.
  - Maybe you can make a virtual representation of your collection in Spotify. 
- APIs: Discogs API, Spotify API
